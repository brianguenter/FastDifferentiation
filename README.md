FastDifferentiation (**FD**) is a package for generating efficient executables to evaluate derivatives of Julia functions. It can also generate efficient true symbolic derivatives for symbolic analysis. 

Unlike forward and reverse mode automatic differentiation **FD** automatically generates efficient derivatives for arbitrary function types: ℝ¹->ℝ¹, ℝ¹->ℝᵐ, ℝⁿ->ℝ¹, and ℝⁿ->ℝᵐ, m≠1,n≠1. **FD** is similar to [D*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-d-symbolic-differentiation-algorithm/) in that it uses the derivative graph[^a] but **FD** is asymptotically faster so it can be applied to much larger expression graphs.

For f:ℝⁿ->ℝᵐ with n,m large FD may have better performance than conventional AD algorithms because the **FD** algorithm finds expressions shared between partials and computes them only once. In some cases **FD** derivatives can be as efficient as manually coded derivatives (see the Lagrangian dynamics example in the [D*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-d-symbolic-differentiation-algorithm/) paper or the Benchmarks section of the documentation for another example).

 **FD** may take much less time to compute symbolic derivatives than Symbolics.jl even in the ℝ¹->ℝ¹ case[^b]. The executables generated by **FD** may also be much faster (see the documentation for more details). 

You should consider using FastDifferentiation when you need: 
* a fast executable for evaluating the derivative of a function and the overhead of the preprocessing/compilation time is swamped by evaluation time.
* to do additional symbolic processing on your derivative. **FD** can generate a true symbolic derivative to be processed further in Symbolics.jl or another computer algebra system.

This is the **FD** feature set:

Jᵀv and Jv compute the Jacobian transpose times a vector and the Jacobian times a vector, without explicitly forming the Jacobian matrix. For applications see this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01892). Hv computes the Hessian times a vector without explicitly forming the Hessian matrix.

See the documentation for more information on the capabilities and limitations of **FD**.

If you use FD in your work please share the functions you differentiate with me. I'll add them to the benchmarks. The more functions available to test the easier it is for others to determine if FD will help with their problem.

This is **beta** software being modified on a daily basis. Expect bugs and frequent, possibly breaking changes, over the next month or so. Documentation is frequently updated so check the latest docs before filing an issue. Your problem may have been fixed and documented.

## FAQ

**Q**: Does **FD** support complex numbers?  
**A**: Not currently.

**Q**: You say **FD** computes efficient derivatives but the printed version of my symbolic derivatives is very long. How can that be efficient?  
**A**: **FD** stores and evaluates the common subexpressions in your function just once. But, the print function recursively descends through all expressions in the directed acyclic graph representing your function, including nodes that have already been visited. The printout can be exponentially larger than the internal **FD** representation.

**Q**: How about matrix and tensor expressions?  
**A**: Evaluation of an **FD** expression returns a graph, not a number. If you multiply a matrix of **FD** variables times a vector of **FD** variables the matrix vector multiplication loop is effectively unrolled into scalar expressions. Matrix operations on large matrices will generate large executables and long preprocessing time. **FD** functions with up 10⁵ operations should still have reasonable preprocessing/compilation times (approximately 1 minute on a modern laptop) and good run time performance.

**Q**: Does **FD** support conditionals?  
**A**: **FD** does not yet support conditionals that involve the variables you are differentiating with respect to. You can do this:
```julia
@variables x y #create FD variables

julia> f(a,b,c) = a< 1.0 ? cos(b) : sin(c)
f (generic function with 2 methods)

julia> f(0.0,x,y)
cos(x)

julia> f(1.0,x,y)
sin(y)
```
but you can't do this:
```julia
julia> f(a,b) = a < b ? cos(a) : sin(b)
f (generic function with 2 methods)

julia> f(x,y)
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching isless(::FastDifferentiation.Node{Symbol, 0}, ::FastDifferentiation.Node{Symbol, 0})
```
This is actively being worked on. I hope to have experimental support for conditionals soon.



[^b]: I am working with the SciML team to see if it is possible to integrate **FD** differentiation directly into Symbolics.jl.
